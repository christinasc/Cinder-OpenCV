This is the OpenCV CinderBlock, designed for use with the open-source C++ library Cinder: http://libcinder.org

Integrates OpenCV 2.3.

If you are using any other modules other than the core: 

You must Add to my target's "Other Linker Flags" (both debug and release) to get any non-samples running:

example: Macosx

$(CINDER_PATH)/blocks/lib/macosx/libopencv_XXXX.a

example: iOS 

$(CINDER_PATH)/blocks/lib/ios/libopencv_XXXX.a

Failure to link the libraries will cause compile time errors because the classes cannot be found.
